## About The Project

After searching for a lot of scripts in my lifetime I started to gather them in a repository. Of course I was not as tidy as the scripts in this repository, but I tried to be as thorough as I could be.

These are the subjects of my scripts;

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Active Directory | The local AD |
| Computer | Specific computer(s) or server(s) |
| Endpoint - Intune | Scripts to be used with Intune |
| Microsoft Graph | Talk to the Microsoft cloud via the API |

Of course nobody is perfect. I have a specific style which could not match yours. If you have any hints to improve, feel free to let me know; [floris@entermi](mailto:floris@entermi.nl)

## Built With/for

I tried to keep everything compatible with Powershell 7 and Powershell 5.x.

## Usage

These scripts are built to run from the shell using parameters. Examples are;

PS > .\Set-DNSServersOnServers.ps1 -OldDns 10.0.0.10 -NewDns '10.0.0.100','10.0.0.200' -Computername 'NLSERVER'
PS > .\Set-DNSServersOnServers.ps1 -Secret 'I_261~ISZAkiEW6yupjiNGk-ZdZrY1f7zwFpzbx3' -Id 'dd372274-a277-11ed-a8fc-0242ac120002' -Version 'beta'

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/florisvanenter/powershell/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

It is a work-in-progress repository. So scripts will be added when found/needed.
